    "For a brief introduction, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine) and the first section of [1601.02036](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02036.pdf)\n",

    "Based on the value on the nodes, as well as the trainable parameters, an energy can be computed, which can be used to determine the probability of a sample $p_\\text{model}(h,v)$.\n",

    "Using the calculated probability for h and v, and then summing over all possible configurations of h, we can compute the marginal probability for a given state of v.   $p_\\text{model}(v)$. \n",

    "## Restricted Boltzmann Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "A fully connected Boltzmann Machine is hard to train. To simplify things, people used Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM).\n",
    "\n",
    "For RBM, there is no inter-connections between hidden nodes, nor inter-connections between visible nodes. There are connections between hidden nodes and visible nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Restricted Boltzmann Machine ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Restricted_Boltzmann_machine.svg/220px-Restricted_Boltzmann_machine.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage is that it makes the conditional probability $p(\\vec{v}|\\vec{h})$ easier to calculate, since the visible nodes are independent of each other. Similarly, $p(\\vec{h}|\\vec{v})$ is easier to calculate. This enables one to use Contrastive Divergence (CD-n) or Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD-n) methods.\n",
